TCL (Tool Command Language) is widely used in the VLSI sector for scripting and automation in electronic design automation (EDA) operations.
It's utilised to automate operations including design setup, simulation, synthesis, timing analysis, and verification. 
TCL is also used to set design restrictions, integrate several EDA tools, create test benches, test chips, and customise and enhance tool functionality.
TCL, in general, plays an important role in streamlining the design processes and increasing productivity in the VLSI sector.
